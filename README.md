# G8_DSA_Final
INFR-2820U -Final Project

Finding the shortest path to a point or destination is something that everyone does on a day-to-day basis. In this project, we are exploring Dijkstra's algorithm, which is one of the best in finding shortest path between two points. We are using the sample data that depicts multiple points and charging stations. This project aims to implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path to given charging stations and recommend the best charging station to go to from a point

The Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented using the function  'dijkstra(graph, start)' which accepts the graph and start node as arguments
It returns list with 'distances' to each node from the source. 

This list is then used to find the best charging station to go to from the starting node.
